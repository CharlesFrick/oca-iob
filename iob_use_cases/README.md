# Indicator of behavior use cases

The Indicator of Behavior Sub-Project within the Open Cybersecurity Alliance has has created several reference implementations of machine readable representations of cyber adversary behavior. The reference implementations are in Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) version 2.1 and are available within this repository. To assist our community with the use of these representations, the IOB Sub-Project is providing use cases for IOB STIX bundles.

The following diagram provides a high level overview of the use cases:

## BPMN reference

The use cases are provided in Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) format. The following diagram provides an overview of the BPMN elements used within these workflows.

BPMN is a standard for modeling business process that is used for the workflows in this repository. It is maintained by the Object Management Group and full documentation is available on the [BPMN Specification Website](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/). These files are based in XML and can be read using a variety of [tools](https://bpmnmatrix.github.io).
